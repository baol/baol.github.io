# PDFCube

![PDFCube Screenshot](/public/pdfcube.jpg)

In 2015 PDFCube finally moved from a very long history of self-hosting
with subversion and trac to [GitHub](http://github.com/baol/pdfcube).

Born in a few sleepless nights before graduation, it had since,
despite being written in an horrible style, gained some popularity (and free beers)
to the author(s).

Blazingly fast, flicker free, cubic, PDF presentation viewer for the
masses. Loved by Latex Beamer users worldwide.
