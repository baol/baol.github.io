Hi,
I'm a software developer interested in free software, complex algorithms, operations research, and security. I co-founded the LILiK free software lab in Florence, Italy, but this happened in the previous millennium.

You can take a look at my research on [Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=rc-liiQAAAAJ&hl=en), and some of my unfinished personal projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/baol)

In particular:
- [METSlib](https://github.com/coin-or/metslib) a framework to help solving big combinatorial optimization problems that I used in a paper on VRP and was also used to develop the [Routist](http://www.routist.com) fleet optimization engine when I founded the KKT startup a few years ago, 
- [Waving-z](https://github.com/baol/waving-z) a software radio modulator and demodulator for z-wave signals,
- [PDFCube](https://github.com/baol/pdfcube) a quick hack to display pdf presentations fast and with a 3d effect that does not suck,
- [Rose](https://github.com/baol/rose) a personalizable tile generator for 3D printers and infinite asymmetric Penrose tiling,

I have developed some expertise in location optimization and location algorithms at scale and am now working [here](http://here.com) as Software Architect (practically more like a Platform Staff Engineer).
